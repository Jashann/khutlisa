"""What the California State Controller asks for when someone claims unclaimed property.

Every rule here was read on the Controller's own pages on 11 Nov 2026. docs/CALIFORNIA_CLAIMS.md holds the
quotes, the source for each one, and the list of things the Controller's pages do not settle. Where this module
goes beyond the Controller's words (which document kinds we accept for an item, which property types count as
securities) the comment says so.
